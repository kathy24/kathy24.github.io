    <p><b>Bio:</b> I am a high school girl living in California. I really enjoy coding and hope to major in CS in college. I am always busy studying and stressing out about grades, but when I have free time, you would find me on Youtube or listening to music.</p>
    <p></p>
    
    <p><b>Likes:</b> I really love both playing and listening to music, especially Kpop. My favorite group is BTS! They are very funny and inspirational. <br>
      <b>Dislikes:</b> I really do not like bugs, especially spiders. It's well know that I will scream no matter how small the spider is.<br>
    </p>
    
      <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> I have traveled to many places. Some interantional travels include France, Italy, Germany, Russia, Denmark, Korea, China, and Japan. In the US, I have been to Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania. <br></p>
    
      <p><b>Favorite Websites:</b>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>: I waste too much time on this website instead of doing homework. </li>
        <li><a href="http://vumoo.li/">Vumoo</a>: A great place to watch free movies</li>
        <li><a href="https://kissasian.es/">Kissasian</a>: Where I watch my favorite Kdramas </li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>
      <p><b>Recent Dramas I have Watched:</b><br><br>
      <b>While You Were Sleeping</b><br>
      Recently, I have been trying to catch up on some dramas that I didn't find time to finish, the main one being While You Were Sleeping. I loved that drama when I began watching it not only because I love the actor who plays the main character, but also because the plot is unpredictable unlike some other dramas. <br><br>
